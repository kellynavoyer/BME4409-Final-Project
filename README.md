# BME4409-Final-Project
An Immunology-Focused Mathematical Approach to Early Glioma Growth

Background Summary of the Original Model (for clarity)
The original model by Sturrock et al. involves 4 variables:

𝑇
(
𝑡
)
T(t): tumor (glioma) concentration

𝜎
brain
(
𝑡
)
σ 
brain
​
 (t): glucose in brain

𝐼
(
𝑡
)
I(t): immune system activity

𝜎
serum
(
𝑡
)
σ 
serum
​
 (t): glucose in serum

The original immune term was wholly negative, meaning the immune system was treated as entirely anti-oncogenic (tumor-suppressive). This oversimplifies glioma immunology, where pro-tumor immune phenotypes (e.g., M2 macrophages, Tregs) are common.
