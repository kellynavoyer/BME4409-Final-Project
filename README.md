# BME4409-Final-Project
An Immunology-Focused Mathematical Approach to Early Glioma Growth

Background Summary of the Original Model (for clarity)
The original model by Sturrock et al. involves 4 variables:

洧녢
(
洧노
)
: tumor (glioma) concentration

洧랥
brain
(
洧노
)
: glucose in brain

洧냪
(
洧노
)
: immune system activity

洧랥
serum
(
洧노
)
: glucose in serum

The original immune term was wholly negative, meaning the immune system was treated as entirely anti-oncogenic (tumor-suppressive). This oversimplifies glioma immunology, where pro-tumor immune phenotypes (e.g., M2 macrophages, Tregs) are common.
